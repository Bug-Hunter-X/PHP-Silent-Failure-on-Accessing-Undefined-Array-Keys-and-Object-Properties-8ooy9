In PHP, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with array keys that aren't explicitly defined.  Consider this scenario:

```php
$myArray = [];
$myArray['a'] = 1;
$myArray['b'] = 2;
echo $myArray['c']; // Notice the undefined key 'c'
```

PHP, by default, won't throw an error if you try to access an undefined array key. Instead, it silently returns `null`, which can lead to unexpected behavior and difficult-to-debug issues further down the line. This is especially insidious in complex applications where data flows through multiple functions.

Another situation is when dealing with objects that might not have properties set.  Accessing undefined properties also returns null, with no warning.

```php
class MyClass {
  public $name;
}

$obj = new MyClass();
echo $obj->age; // undefined property, returns null
```
